# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach emphasizes customer-first thinking, iterative delivery, and clear ownership to deliver value efficiently. Every project begins with a **Project One-pager** that defines the problem statement, measurable goals, success metrics, and stakeholder alignment. This lightweight artifact ensures teams understand the "why" before diving into execution. Projects pass through a **decision gate** where sponsors and product leads confirm priority, team availability, and clarity of success criteria before moving into planning. This initiation phase establishes a foundation of alignment and intentionality that guides the entire project lifecycle.

Planning and execution workflows center on breaking work into shippable increments using a prioritized backlog and structured project board with columns for Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done. Each **backlog item** follows a template with clear acceptance criteria, priority, and ownership to minimize ambiguity. The team follows a **Pull Request (PR) workflow** that emphasizes small PRs (ideally under 400 lines), automated CI checks for tests and linting, and at least one peer approval before merging. A **release checklist** ensures that deployments include end-to-end smoke tests, security scans, and stakeholder notifications. This structured approach supports continuous integration, rapid feedback cycles, and consistent quality across releases.

OctoAcme relies on four core roles with distinct ownership responsibilities. The **Project Manager (PM)** coordinates delivery activities, manages schedules, risks, and dependencies, and facilitates team meetings and stakeholder communication. The **Product Manager (PdM)** defines what to build, prioritizes the roadmap and backlog, and measures outcomes against success metrics. **Developers** implement features, write tests, participate in code reviews, and help identify technical risks and solutions. **QA personnel** validate acceptance criteria, conduct feature testing, and ensure quality standards are met before release. Each role contributes specialized expertise while collaborating closely to deliver customer value on time.

Communication and quality assurance are embedded throughout the project lifecycle. The team holds **daily standups** to address blockers and coordinate work, **weekly delivery syncs** between PM and PdM to review progress and manage risks, and **retrospectives** at project close to capture learnings and action items. Quality assurance includes **unit tests** for new logic, **integration tests** for system interactions, **end-to-end tests** for critical user flows, and **security scans** run automatically in CI pipelines. A **risk register** tracks identified risks with impact, likelihood, mitigation plans, and ownership, updated weekly during syncs. Escalation paths are clear: team-level issues are triaged in standups, PM escalates to product leads and dependent teams for cross-functional blockers, and sponsor-level escalation handles business-impacting concerns. This blend of regular communication touchpoints and rigorous testing ensures transparency, quality, and timely resolution of issues.
